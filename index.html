                <li>What did I actually understand (not just read or hear)?</li>
                <li>What surprised me, disturbed me, or challenged my assumptions?</li>
                <li>How does this connect to something I already know?</li>
                <li>Did this change how I see something, even slightly?</li>
                <li>What questions did this leave me with?</li>
                <li>How does this reflect who I am becoming?</li>
                <li>One sentence to carry into the next week.</li>
